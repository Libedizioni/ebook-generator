# Ebook Generator
#### _changelog & history_

This ebook generator is meant to simplify the efforts required to publish an ebook in different formats, starting with just a base set of .docx files.

It takes advantage of [Pandoc] to convert between file formats, and uses grunt to perform its tasks as well as for compiling assets like css and images used in the ebook.

For more information, please take a look at the [**project's Wiki**](http://github.com/Libedizioni/ebook-generator/wiki)

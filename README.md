# Ebook Generator

_**Ebook Generator is a simple starter workflow to edit and generate an ebook in different output formats, starting from a set of one or more .docx files.**_
<br>


It uses [**Grunt**](http://gruntjs.com/) to manage a set of different common tasks performed to edit and format the ebook prior to generate the final version, and it uses [**Sass**](http://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor to keep all CSS modules separated with a clean structure, and it ships a basic set of well commented .scss files ready to start-off.

It is also equipped with a starter set of [**Pandoc**](http://pandoc.org/) templates to customize, for epub, epub3, html, html5 and pdf, synced with Pandoc default templates.
